## Processing Book

To guide our activites, we will be using Make's _Getting Started with Processing: A Hands-on Introduction to Making Interactive Graphics_ ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Processing-Hands-Introduction/dp/1457187086/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)). At the end of camp, you will get to keep your copy of the book. 

## Download Processing

Since this is a summer camp, there is no homework. However, if you'd like to explore Processing at home, you are free (and encouraged!) to download the Processing IDE [here](https://processing.org/download/).

## Additional Processing Resources

- [Raspberry Pi Foundation's Introduction to Processing](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/introduction-to-processing/worksheet/)

## Contact Me

I am available before/after class to answer any questions you have.
