# Welcome to Camp Troubie 2017!

hello, world!
```

You will be able to find all content and information about our course here. For each class you will have access to an agenda, objectives, source files, and assignments. I look forward to our time together over these few weeks!


## Calendar

## Download Processing

Since this is a summer camp, there is no homework. However, if you'd like to explore Processing at home, you are free (and encouraged!) to download the Processing IDE [here](https://processing.org/download/).

## Contact Me

I am available before/after class to answer any questions you have.
